#  Bellabeat Case Study â€“ Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

This project is a part of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** on Coursera. It analyzes Fitbit data from Bellabeat users to derive insights on their activity, sleep, and weight trends, using **Python** for analysis and **Tableau** for visualization.

## Dataset

- Source: [Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)
- Contains anonymized data for 30 users across:
  - Daily activity (`dailyActivity_merged.csv`)
  - Sleep data (`sleepDay_merged.csv`)
  - Weight log (`weightLogInfo_merged.csv`)
-This dataset includes Fitbit data from 33 users, although data availability varies across activity, sleep, and weight logs.

##  Tools Used

- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** â€“ Data cleaning and EDA
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Analysis notebook
- **Tableau Public** â€“ Final dashboard for visualization

---

##  Key Analyses

- Average steps per day: ~7,638
- Most active days: Monday & Saturday
- Average sleep duration: ~6.99 hours
- Weak negative correlation between BMI and steps
- Positive correlation between steps and calories burned

---

##  Final Dashboard

A 4-chart Tableau dashboard was created to visualize insights:

- **Bar Chart**: Avg steps per weekday
- **Histogram**: Sleep hours distribution
- **Scatter Plot**: Steps vs Calories burned
- **Scatter Plot**: BMI vs Steps

##  Business Recommendations

- Encourage more consistent daily activity to reach 10,000 steps
- Promote longer sleep durations (aim for 8+ hours)
- Encourage more users to log their weight for improved BMI tracking
- Use personalized insights to increase user engagement
